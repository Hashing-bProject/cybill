## Introduction
CyBill (pronounced: Sigh-Bill) is a cryptocurrency for everyone. CyBill was derived from 
the Mayan (Yucatan) word, Sibill for gift. The first cryptocurrency, BitCoin is not really 
a coin but is more a chain of trusted transactions. This chain is verified digitally to 
prove accuracy and trust in the transaction. It is our intent that the CyBill be a bill of 
currency protected and trusted using Bitcoin's well-tested block-chain technology. The 
CyBill can be mined using common CPU processing. The implemented algorithm prevents miners 
using ASIC or GPU processing because the algorithm throttles this form of mining and 
excessive energy waste. So you can mine CyBill with common hardware like your PC, laptop, 
Macbook, cell phone, or even a Raspberry Pi. Mining software will be written to compile on 
many different platforms.

CyBill is an online payment system that provides a virtual currency that can be given to 
anyone in the world without using an intermediary such as a bank. And, like cash, this coin 
supports financial transactions between people and not corporations. CyBill coins can be 
minted by computational devices including personal computers and portable devices through 
special algorithms called proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS). CyBill aims at 
fairness, cost effective and energy efficiency during coin minting. CyBill is a hybrid 
PoW/PoS-based cryptocurrency that aims to provide stable, secure, and steady value. CyBill 
is considered a CPU coin.

## Features
CyBill aims to provide stable value in a coin that can be used easily around the world. The 
CI Wise developers will have stake in the technology behind the issue, use, and security of 
the coin. With this ownership comes responsibility. The CI Wise developers will have great 
responsibility for it's value. Our strategy for valuation and stability of the coin is still 
under draft.

CyBill's proof-of-work (PoW) protocol is being reviewed and refactored. Proof of Work (PoW) 
is a network-dependent rewarding model system. The PoW rewards participants who solve 
complicated cryptographical questions and validate transactions. It is also used to create 
new blocks in order to generate coins. The coins mined via PoW are adjusted and balanced by 
two primary mechanisms: 1) stimulating network activities by issuing rewards, and 2) 
mitigating redundant mining sources by reducing rewards.

CyBill's proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol is also being reviewed and refactored. Proof of Stake 
(PoS) aims to achieve distributed consensus through operations in addition to PoW. PoS is 
designed such that it rejects potential attacks, for example, through accumulating a large 
amount of coins or offline stake time. CyBill will hybridizes PoW with PoS, integrating both 
consensus approaches in order to acquire benefits from the two mechanisms. PoS particularly 
enhances the overall security of CyBill as a cryptocurrency.
