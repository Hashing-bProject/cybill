The sources in this directory are Boost unit test cases. Boost provides
the unit testing framework.

The build system is setup to compile an executable called "test_cybill"
that runs all of the unit tests.  The main source file is called
test_cybill.cpp, which simply includes other files that contain the
actual unit tests (outside of a couple required preprocessor
directives).  The pattern is to create one test file for each class or
source file for which you want to create unit tests.  The file naming
convention is "<source_filename>_tests.cpp" and such files should wrap
their tests in a test suite called "<source_filename>_tests".  For
examples of this pattern, examine uint160_tests.cpp and uint256_tests.cpp.

For further reading, I found the following website to be helpful in
explaining how the boost unit test framework works:
